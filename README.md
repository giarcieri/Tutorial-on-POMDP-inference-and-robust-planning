# Tutorial-on-POMDP-inference-and-robust-planning

This is a tutorial for the paper "Bridging POMDPs and Bayesian decision making for robust maintenance planning under model uncertainty: An application to railway systems" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07933), which shows how to infer POMDP model parameter distributions from available data and how to incorporate all distributions into the POMDP solution to derive an optimal policy robust to model uncertainty.
